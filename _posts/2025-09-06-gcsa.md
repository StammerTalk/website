We are pleased to announce the successful establishment of the Global Chinese Stuttering Association (GCSA) and our approval as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in the United States.

This milestone enables us to broaden programs, partnerships, and advocacy to better support Chinese people who stutter globally.

Thank you to all who contributed to this achievement. We look forward to continuing to serve and empower our worldwide community.
