We are thrilled to announce that the StammerTalk Mandarin Stuttered Speech Dataset is now publicly available on Hugging Face! üéâ

## Dataset Overview

The StammerTalk dataset represents a significant milestone in stuttering research, containing **43 hours of spontaneous conversations and reading of voice commands** by **66 Mandarin Chinese speakers who stutter**. This comprehensive dataset includes both unscripted conversations and dictation of 200 voice commands, providing valuable resources for automatic speech recognition and stuttering event detection research.

**Note**: This publicly available dataset is a subset of the complete [AS-70 dataset](https://aishelltech.com/aishell_6a), as it includes only the data from participants who provided consent for public sharing. The full AS-70 dataset contains additional recordings that remain private due to differentiating consent agreements with participants.

## A Heartfelt Thank You to AImpower.org

We extend our deepest gratitude to **[AImpower.org](https://aimpower.org/)** for their incredible partnership in making this dataset publicly available. Their dedication to advancing AI research for social good has been instrumental in bringing this resource to the global research community. The collaborative effort between StammerTalk and AImpower.org demonstrates the power of community-driven research initiatives.

## What Makes This Dataset Special

- **Authentic voices**: Speech data collected by StammerTalk volunteers who also stutter, creating a comfortable and understanding environment for participants
- **Comprehensive annotations**: Verbatim transcriptions with five distinct stuttering event annotations embedded in markups
- **Community-driven**: Created by the StammerTalk (Âè£ÂêÉËØ¥) community at [stammertalk.net](http://stammertalk.net/)
- **Research-ready**: Professional transcription and annotation, reviewed by StammerTalk volunteers

## Access the Dataset

The dataset is now available at:
**[https://huggingface.co/datasets/AImpower/MandarinStutteredSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AImpower/MandarinStutteredSpeech)**

This release marks an important step forward in making stuttering research more accessible and inclusive. We hope this dataset will enable researchers worldwide to develop better tools and technologies that support the stuttering community.

Thank you to all the participants who generously shared their voices, the StammerTalk volunteers who conducted the data collection, and AImpower.org for their unwavering support in making this dataset available to the world. Together, we're building a more inclusive future for speech technology! üí™
