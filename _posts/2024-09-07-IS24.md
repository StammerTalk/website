I am very proud to present our dataset work "AS-70: a Mandarin stuttered speech dataset" on Interspeech 2024 in Kos, Greece. I am also very happy to meet our co-authors [Shaomei Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaomei/) from [AImpower](https://aimpower.org/) and Hongfei Xue from [ASLP lab of Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.npu-aslp.org/). It was a very nice experience, and I hope to see you guys soon!
