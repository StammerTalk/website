Rong presented our dataset work "AS-70: A Mandarin stuttered speech dataset for automatic speech recognition and stuttering event detection" on Interspeech 2024 in Kos, Greece. He was very happy to meet our co-authors [Shaomei Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaomei/) from [AImpower](https://aimpower.org/) and Hongfei Xue from [ASLP lab of Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.npu-aslp.org/). It was a very nice experience, and we hope to see you guys soon!
