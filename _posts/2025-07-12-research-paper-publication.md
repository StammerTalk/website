We are excited to announce the publication of our research paper **"Our Collective Voices: The Social and Technical Values of a Grassroots Chinese Stuttered Speech Dataset"** at the **2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '25)**! ðŸŽ‰

## A Collaborative Achievement

We are deeply grateful to our partners at **[AImpower.org](https://aimpower.org/)** for their incredible collaboration on this research. The first and second authors, **Jingjin Li** and **Qisheng Li**, are from AImpower, while the third and fourth authors, **Rong Gong** and **Lezhi Wang**, are from the StammerTalk community. This partnership exemplifies the power of community-driven research and inclusive AI development.

## Key Findings

The research demonstrates how grassroots, community-led data efforts can expose and rectify fluency bias in speech AI systems while fostering self-advocacy and community-building. Our fine-tuned ASR models showed substantial improvements:
- **Mild stuttering**: Error rate reduced from 16.34% to 5.8%
- **Moderate stuttering**: Error rate dropped from 21.72% to 9.03%
- **Severe stuttering**: Error rate decreased from 49.24% to 20.46%

The paper also reveals significant social challenges faced by people who stutter in China, including stigma, workplace discrimination, and limited professional support access.
