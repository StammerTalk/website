## Online self-help groups

In self-help groups, we encourage PWS and parents to share their stuttering experiences. The benefits of participating in a self-help group include:

* Practice speaking a supportive and non-judgmental environment.
* Find friendship and support from people who can understand your experiences and feelings.
* Gain confidence and motivation from seeing other members who achieve their life and career goals with stuttering.
* Learn the strategies and tips from other members and so much more ...
