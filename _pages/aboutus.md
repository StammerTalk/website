Global Chinese Stuttering Association (GCSA) was founded in 2024 in East Lansing, Michigan, as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Its predecessor, StammerTalk, was founded in 2019 by a group of Mandarin-speaking individuals who stutter (PWS) living abroad. The initial activity was creating a podcast to raise awareness about stuttering in Mainland China. Since then, the organization has expanded to offer online resources, including videos on stuttering management strategies, self-help groups, and academic research activities. StammerTalk has co-hosted the World Stuttering Awareness Day online events for Mandarin-speaking PWS in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
