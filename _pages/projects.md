## Projects

### Podcast

We interview people who stutter (PWS), speech-language therapists (SLPs), and stuttering researchers to foster open discussions about stuttering, inspire PWS with real-life experiences, and promote scientific understanding of stuttering. Our audio podcast interviews are available on Spotify and 喜马拉雅, and our video podcast interviews can be accessed on Bilibili.

### Evidence-based stuttering resources

In Mainland China, PWS and parents of children who stutter are eager to access scientific techniques for managing stuttering, helping them better navigate daily challenges. These techniques range from classic methods such as fluency shaping and speech modification to modern approaches like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Global Chinese Stuttering Association (GCSA), previously known as StammerTalk, invites professional SLPs to present these techniques and translates relevant materials from collaborators.

### World Stuttering Awareness Day online events and Workshops

We collaborates with SLPs and researchers to co-host World Stuttering Awareness Day online events, featuring knowledge sharing, open-mic sessions, and roundtable discussions with PWS and SLPs. GCAA also actively organize online workshops on professional stuttering treatment topics and host Q&A sessions.

### Research

#### AISHELL-Stammertalk Mandarin stuttered speech dataset

GCAA is leading the research project to create the first Mandarin stuttered speech dataset, AISHELL-Stammertalk. We believe this dataset will significantly advance research and development in Mandarin stuttered speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Stuttering Event Detection (SED), as well as contribute to speech pathology research.

We work closely with [AISHELL](https://aishelltech.com/){:target="_blank"} and [AImpower.org](https://aimpower.org/){:target="_blank"} to ensure the ethical and compliant collection of data. Our goal is to provide high-quality, well-annotated data suitable for various research topics.

The AISHELL-Stammertalk dataset includes recordings from 70 native Mandarin-speaking adults who stutter (AWS), consisting of 46 males and 24 females, with a total duration of 48.8 hours. Each participant took part in a recording session lasting up to one hour, divided into two parts: conversation and voice command reading.
